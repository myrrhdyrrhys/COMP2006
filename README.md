Operating Systems (Year 2, Semester 1)

A second year unit that went into detail about the makeup of Operating Systems, their main purposes and how they achieve these tasks. There was a large focus on thread handling and CPU scheduling, ideas about deadlock detection, prevention and avoidance, management of memory (paging, segmentation, virtual memory, data access methods), input/output management and security.

The files in this repository are for an assignment to do with simulating different types of CPU scheduling using pthreads, locks and mutexes in a C program. Refer to the README.txt in the repository for instructions to run the program.
